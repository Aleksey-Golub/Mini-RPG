It has lost its former appeal because of construction of new road and is gradually empties. Rare travelers and traders are now a big deal here in town. The local inhabitants are hunters, fishermen and peasants. There are some buildings - shop with all necessities, hostelry, town hall, and private households\"\n\nOnce again, you have finished re-reading the fact sheet you have received from the garrison clerk.\nAnd you were sent to this godsforsaken place by the garrison commander: \"To investigate the cause of the local residents' anxiety\".\nBut it's only a couple of hunters lost in the woods and a mushroom picker was killed by wolves. It's quite a common situation for such a backwoods location. The peasants have always been prone to excessive drama, what can you expect of them?",
