GUI_Label_Intro == ""Chistovodie" is a small provincial town, lost in the woods, located on an old trading road near the river. It is quiet and peaceful. It has lost its former appeal because of construction of new road and is gradually empties. Rare travelers and traders are now a big deal here in town. The local inhabitants are hunters, fishermen and peasants. There are some buildings - shop with all necessities, hostelry, town hall, and private households."@@Once again, you have finished re-reading the fact sheet you have received from the garrison clerk.@And you were sent to this godsforsaken place by the garrison commander: "To investigate the cause of the local residents' anxiety".@But it's only a couple of hunters lost in the woods and a mushroom picker was killed by wolves. It's quite a common situation for such a backwoods location. The peasants have always been prone to excessive drama, what can you expect of them?
