FAQ_DiceSystem == The 2D6 и D100 systems
The game uses a rule system where all actions and their results are solved by rolling two six-sided dice (2D6) and comparing the result against a target difﬁculty. The result of the roll is often modified by bonus or penalty modiﬁers which are simply added to the roll before comparing the ﬁnal result against the target difﬁculty. If the ﬁnal modiﬁed result equals or exceeds the target difﬁculty, the action succeeds. If the result is lower than the target difﬁculty, the action fails. If the result of both dice are 1's, the action critically fails even if the modiﬁed result would otherwise succeed. If the result from both dice are 6's and the action is capable of succeeding critically and the action succeeds even if the modiﬁed result would otherwise fail.
The 100-sided dice roll (D100) is mainly used to determine the probability of finding items and enemies.

FAQ_AbilityModifiers == Ability Modifiers
Ability modifiers are applied to ability checks when a creature attempts to do something related to that ability. Ability modiﬁers are also used to modify damage rolls and various other instances and events that may or may not be directly related to the creature. 
A positive modifier is called a bonus, and a negative modifier is called a penalty. 
Ability modifiers range from -5 to +8 on a linear scale where an ability value of 2 grants -5 modiﬁer, a value of 7 grants +0 modiﬁer, and a value of 12 grants +5 modiﬁer. Character`s abilities can not exceed 12 and modiﬁers can not go beyond +5 but in some cases some enemies may have more. 

FAQ_AbilityChecks == Ability Checks
Every action requires an ability check of some sort. Ability checks receive a modiﬁer to the check from one of the abilities. The difﬁculty of an ability check varies depending on the situation.
The default difﬁculty level for an ability check is 7, which means that the check is successful if the sum of a 2D6 roll and any applicable modiﬁers equals or exceeds 7.

FAQ_Health == Health
Health measures how many points of damage a creature may take before it is killed.
A creature's health value depends on Constitution and Level, enemies health may be calculated based on different rules.
For example, a 4th level character with a base Constitution value of 8 has 11 health (8 + 2 + 1 = 11) (CON + CON-bonus + Level Modifier) (Level Modifier = Level / 2 with rounding upwards).
There are several ways to regain health, including but not limited to overnight stay in an inn, potions, and resting. The most affordable way to regain health is to eat and drink until satiated, and rest. In order to regain health by resting, a creature must have one or both of hunger and thirst states as satiety, while the other is either not hunger, or not thirst, and then rest. The following formula is used to determine whether a creature gains health when resting and the criteria above is met:
2D6 + Stamina Modiﬁer >= 12 (or 10 if both satiated).

FAQ_Damage == Damage
The resulting damage depends on weapon damage, damage type, armor type, armor value, and critical damage fact and is calculated by the following formula:
Damage = (Weapon Damage + Offensive Modifier - (Armor Value * Vulnerability Coefficient)) * Critical Damage Modifier

Critical Damage Modifier - equals 1 for non-critical hits and usually equals 1.5 for critical.
